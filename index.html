  <h1>PLAN 221: VISUALIZING YOURSELF</h1>
  <h3>Alifia Hajiani and Sid Ahuja</h3>

    <p>
      Music has been an integral part of human culture for centuries, serving as a medium for expression, entertainment, and communication.
      Being an important part of our daily routines, we wanted to explore how we interact with music, examining our listening habits and how much overlap exists in our music tastes.
      As avid music listeners, we both find that music heavily impact our mood, but conversely, our mood can also determine the music we gravitate towards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conveniently, Spotify provides users with their listening data upon request.
      Using the Spotify API, Python, and R, we were able to wrangle and analyze the data,
      generating interactive figures from which we could draw conclusions and represent our relationship with music through a visualization.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea was to create a dashboard-like interface, possibly extending the project to make a program where
        users can enter their own Spotify credentials to get personalized plots and figures representing their listening habits.
      We wanted to keep the webpage balanced and well organized to achieve the dashboard appearance, ensuring the user is not overwhelmed when using this tool.
      We laid out the plots logically, where related information is grouped together, and attention moves from left to right seamlessly.
      Finally, we used high-saturated colors, green-on-black text elements, and a bold, round typeface to convey the Spotify aesthetic and brand association.
    </p>
    <h2>THE PROCESS AND PLOTS</h2>
    <p>
      The first two maps illustrate our most listened-to genre while we commute on campus, helping us observe how our environment affects our moods, thus affecting our listening activities.
      We chose to look at destinations we frequently commute to and tracked when we commuted to those locations.
      Then by correlating the commute time to the Spotify data, we analyzed which music genres were most listened to.
      It is important to note that Spotify uses over 1500 genres, assigning several genres to the artist rather than the song.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sunburst plot shows our top 30 artists organized by their most basic genre.
      The plot's purpose is to further describe our relationship with music genres and artists that typically fall under those genres.
      Additionally, we can use this plot to compare the differences in the number of top artists of a certain genre between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bar plot shows streams frequency throughout the day represented as a percentage and depicts what times of the day we listen to music and
        how integrated music is in our lives.
    </p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> We only used data from Jan 9, 2023 to Mar 30, 2023, visualizing our second-term listening habits.</p>
    <h2>SOME KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>
    <p>
      We can see that there is more genre variation in Alifia's commute, listening to mostly unique genres between her dorm and the buildings she commutes to.
      In contrast, Sid has less genre variation in his commute.
      Furthermore, we both tend to listen to artists that fall under the Pop, Rock, and Hip-Hop genres.
      Lastly, we observe that Alifia's peak listening time was around 4 pm, typically when she walks to IRC for class.
      Sid's peak time was around 11 pm, when he typically studies, demonstrating the significant relationship between music and his studying routines.
